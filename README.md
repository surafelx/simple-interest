# Simple Interest Calculator Script 📊

This is a simple shell script (`simple-interest.sh`) to calculate the **Simple Interest (SI)** based on the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.

## 🚀 Features

- **Calculate Simple Interest**: Given the principal, rate, and time, the script will calculate the simple interest.
- **Command-Line Input**: Users can input the principal, rate, and time through the command line when running the script.
- **Easy to Use**: Just run the script and input the required values!

## 🛠 Usage

To use the `simple-interest.sh` script, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
```

### 2. Make the Script Executable
Ensure the script has execution permissions:

```bash
chmod +x simple-interest.sh
```

3. Run the Script
Run the script with the required arguments (principal, rate, and time):

```bash
./simple-interest.sh <principal> <rate> <time>
```

**Example**
bash
```bash
./simple-interest.sh 1000 5 2
```
This will calculate the simple interest for a principal of 1000, interest rate of 5%, and a time period of 2 years.

### 4. Output
The script will display the calculated simple interest:

```bash
Simple Interest: 100
```

## 📝 Script Explanation
The formula for calculating Simple Interest (SI) is:

```plaintext
SI = (P * R * T) / 100
```

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Interest rate (in percentage)
- T = Time period (in years)

**Example Calculation:**
For P = 1000, R = 5%, and T = 2 years, the script calculates:

```text
SI = (1000 * 5 * 2) / 100 = 100
```
### 🛠 Technologies Used
